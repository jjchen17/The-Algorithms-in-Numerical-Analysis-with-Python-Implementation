# The-Algorithms-in-Numerical-Analysis-with-Python-Implementation
Nothing special, and I just write them to deepen my comprehension about Scientific Computing.


  I reinvented several wheels that aim to help some learn about the basic algorithms in Scicentific Computing Libraries 
such as NumPy and SciPy.

# Structure.py
Define the relevant objects for basic matrix.

  for instance, some functions about the Inner Products for different objects, and the basic operations for matrices.
  
I also use the methods of Functional Programming to define a matrix in a new way,cconcentrating more on How a matrix's composed with a series of elementary matrices. 
  
# Method.py
Implement some common algorithms about real matrices.

  For example, 
  
    ......

    GaussEq：using Gaussian elimination method to solve the linear equations.
    
    LUEq: using LU Matrix Decomposition method to solve the linear equations.
     
    ......
    
  There're quite a lot of instances in this file can help you understand how we deal with the eigenvalues, ranks and 
  
other objects we care about of a matrix.
